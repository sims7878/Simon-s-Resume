    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I press buttons for a living, sometimes people's buttons though. Currently residing in South Africa, I am the photographer and social media cordinator for The Archive Automotive.
        We look after cars and provide a unique service catering for the automtove industry. <br> <br>
        I am currently on a Web Development journey to learn how to code. I would like to be able to build my own websites.
